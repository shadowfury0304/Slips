1: Check Username, Text Files, and File Copy

a) I want to show all text files on Desktop using grep and pipe commands:-	`ls ~/Desktop/

b) Create file StudentName\_PRN\_No.txt on Desktop using vi, add text "India is my country." Now copy that file to a directory named PRN\_NO\_StudentName in Documents:-
	
1. vi ~/Desktop/StudentName_PRN_No.txt (Enter text and save)
2. mkdir -p ~/Documents/PRN_NO_StudentName

3. cp ~/Desktop/StudentName_PRN_No.txt ~/Documents/PRN_NO_StudentName/

2: a) I want to see currently running processes for the current shell/user.	ps or ps u
   b) Write a shell script to take a file from the user as an argument and disk usage by that file in human readable format:-
      
bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ -f "$1" ]; then\n echo "Disk Usage for $1:";\n du -h "$1"\nelse\n echo "Error: File not found or invalid argument."\nfi\n
